# Regular expression To Nfa Tester

This is an app that converts a regex from infix to postfix and tests it againts a string. 

## Getting Started

To start off my project I first followed video tutorials provided by Dr. Ian Mcloughlin which were provided on my college's learnonline hub at gmit. Following the videos was an easy task but it took me a few watches of each one to fully grasp and understand the complexity of the code provided as well as actually getting my head wrapped around what the project done. 

### Design Process

1.) After following the videos I was left with a line of hard coded code that would test the postfix of a regular expression againts an nfa. The result would either return back true or false on depending on wheteher or not the string matched. The regex that was tested most for me was "ab.c*|" which was tested with many different strings to see the test result such as "ab", "abc" and "ccccccc". Tests would return the desired result and all was well. 

2.)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
